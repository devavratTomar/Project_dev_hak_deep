# Title
 "Food carbon footprint" or "Food allergy" (TBD)
# Abstract

For the sake of social goodness through data stories, we consider that food dataset has a lot of stories to tell about the patterns of food production, consumption and its positive and negative effects on the world. Hence we will start with the Open Food Facts dataset and use other sources regarding to the progress of our ideas.


1. The first idea, about which we are very curious, is  "Food carbon footprint": greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking and disposing of the food we eat. We are interested in finding out the countries, which are emitting huge amount of carbon in the result of food production and consumption, and identify the ways to reduce it. The dataset will give us insights about the products and their origins having highest carbon footprint(i.e. meat, cheese,eggs, so on) and the ones having lower carbon footprints(i.e. fruit, vegetables, beans, nuts so on). Additionally we consider that food packaging and food waste treatment have huge proportion of impact on carbon emission, thus these are hypothesis that we are interested to test and make conclusions about global problems.


2. The second idea is "Food allergy", which happens when human body overreact to exposure to particular substances in the food.
Our aim in this idea is to link a disease dataset containing  information of allowed and not allowed food types of each disease with the food dataset of the ingredients and their proportions. The social goodness of this project is grouping negative and positive affecting food for each type of disease. The novelty of the project will be to identify the 'new' food(not from the already given list) allowance to special groups of people having diseases according to its composition.

The final topic will be decided up until the second milestone!

# Research questions

Food Carbon Footprint:

1. Ways to reduce carbon footprint through cooking smartly, eating organic, shopping wisely, saving water, reusing and recycling.

Food Allergy:

1. Food Allergy Impacts Quality of Life.
2. Avoiding Allergens Requires Careful Reading of Labels and Stringent Cleaning Procedures.
3. Can Food Allergies Be Outgrown?
4. Food Allergy Prevention and Treatment.

# Datasets
1. Open food facts ( https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts/home) is a free, open, collaborative database of food products from around the world, with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the tidbits of information we can find on product labels. Dataset is structured in .csv format, 1GB size, containing  ~138 features. Features will be processed according to our needs.

2. Symptom Disease sorting dataset in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/plarmuseau/sdsort) contains diseases with allergic reactions, so this may be used for "Food allergy" idea to get info of diseases which are food intolerant. Additionally there is Food Allergy Research and Education ( https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/facts-and-statistics) platform for revealing the impact of food allergies and managing  guidelines and new therapies for them. In case of lack of dataset we will request some dataset from their research  request portal.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2 Nov. 25, 2018
Our planned schedule of work till the milestone 2:
1. Week 1: Explore the Open food facts dataset and finalize our final topic of data story.
2. Week 2: Collect data and identify the key features contributing to our project idea.
3. Week 3: Preparing a report about  data collection and descriptive analysis on the collected data. Plan the structure of our data story report.
