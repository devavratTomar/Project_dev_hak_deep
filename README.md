# Title
 "Food carbon footprint" or "Food allergy" (TBD)
# Abstract

For the sake of social goodness through data stories, we consider that food dataset has a lot of stories to tell about the patterns of food production, consumption and its positive and negative effects on the world. Hence we will start with the Open Food Facts dataset and use other sources regarding to the progress of our ideas.


1. Our first idea about which we are very curious, is the "Food carbon footprint": greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking and disposing of the food we eat. We are interested in finding out the countries which are emitting huge amount of carbon in the result of food production and consumption and identify the ways to reduce it. The dataset will give us insights about the products and their origins having highest carbon footprint(meat, cheese,eggs) and the ones having lower carbon footprints( fruit, vegetables, beans and nuts). Additionally we consider that food packaging and treating food waste have huge proportion of impact on carbon emission, thus these are hypothesis that we will are interesting to test and make conclusions about global problems.


2. The second idea is "Food allergy", which happens when human body overreact to exposure to a particular substances in the food.
Our purpose in this idea is to link a disease dataset containing  information of allowed and not allowed food types with the food dataset of the ingredients and their proportions. The social goodness of this project is grouping negative and positive affecting food for each type of disease. The novelty of the project will be to identify the 'new' food(not from the already given list) allowance to special groups of people according to its composition.

The final topic will be decided up until the second milestone!

# Research questions

1. Ways to reduce carbon footprint.
2. Suggesting medical diets to people having disease by data science.

# Datasets
1. Open food facts - is a free, open, collaborative database of food products from around the world, with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the tidbits of information we can find on product labels. Dataset is structured in .csv format, 1GB size, containing  ~138 features.

2. Disease - TBF*


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Dataset Exploration and feature engineering to be able to define our final data story title.
